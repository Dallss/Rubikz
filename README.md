# Rubikz
Rubik's Cube simulation coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

- Although the cube itself is already finished, it still needs some finishing touches on the records section, background animation/music, and homepage. 
- Speaking on personal opinion, the cube is rather hard to solve considering it is a 2D projection of a 3D puzzle. But the point of this project is to showcase my knowledge on the languages used and basic DOM manipulation.
